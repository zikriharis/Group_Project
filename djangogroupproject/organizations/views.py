'''
We use a dictionary so we can give names to the data we pass into the template.
This allows the template to access variables like form, organization, user, etc
It's not specific to forms â€” all data passed to templates goes inside a dictionary.

<form method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    {% csrf_token %}
    {{ form.as_p }}
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
Here, {{ form.as_p }} works because you gave the template access to a variable named form.
